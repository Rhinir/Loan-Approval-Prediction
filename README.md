# Loan-Approval-Prediction

This project aims to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) 
based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. 
These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, 
Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. 

To automate this process, we are given a problem to identify the customers segments, 
those are eligible for loan amount so that we can specifically target these customers.
